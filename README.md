# Book Search Engine Starter Code


## Description
I took a fully functioning Google Books API search engine built with a RESTful API, and refactored it to be a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server. The app was built using the MERN stack, with a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API.
In this application users can create an account and save their favorite books or books they would like to read. Users can then access a page specifically catered to their selection.
